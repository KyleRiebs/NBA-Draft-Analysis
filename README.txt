# README FOR NBA DRAFT COMBINE TO CAREER SUCCESS ANALYSIS
## by Kyle Riebeling

In the directory "\FinalProject_KyleRiebeling\" are the files needed to reproduce the analysis we preformed. You may also view the full analysis report in the pre-knitted "FinalReport_KYLE_RIEBELING.pdf" file.

## Structure

- "\FinalProject_KyleRiebeling\Data" is a folder that contains our two raw data sets we use to create our analysis and where our two processed files will be saved

- "\FinalProject_KyleRiebeling\0*_******.r" are the files we need to include for our report. They include the libraries we used along with the functions we created for our data cleaning and visualization.

- "\FinalProject_KyleRiebeling\1*_******.rmd" are the files where we clean, process, and visualize our data. They are meant to be run in sequential order. Each file includes descriptions of what is being done in them.


## How to reproduce our results

Simple knit each of the 1*_*****.rmd files in sequential order, then knit the FinalReport_KYLE_RIEBELING.rmd file to get the full report. The exact order of files is as follows:

- "11_DataCleaning.rmd"

- "12_DataProcessing.rmd"

- "13_DataVisualization.rmd"

- "FinalReport_KYLE_RIEBELING.rmd"
